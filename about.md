**Biography**: I am currently a Senior Algorithm Engineer at the Risk Management Department in Ant Financial since Jul. 2019. Before that, I was working at Alibaba DAMO Academy since Apr. 2017 and I was an intern there since May 2016. I am now a CFA Level III candidate. I received MEng degree from College of Computer Science of Zhejiang University in 2017. 

**Interests**: I am interested in studying and applying cutting edges quantitative technologies, including statistical inference, machine learning, optimization, to making better business decisions, including finance, E-commerce, e.g. risk management, recommendation, forecasting, pricing, marketing.
